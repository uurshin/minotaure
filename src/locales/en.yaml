  <li>- associate it with a <strong>secondary stat</strong>. If a character gets this tag at creation, it will automatically be their second-strongest stat.</li>
  <li>- associate it with <strong>bonuses</strong> and <strong>penalties</strong> that modify the initial stats roll or the starting value of certain bars.</li>
  <li>- increase or decrease its random attribution <strong>probability</strong>.</li>
